# MNIST – Baseline Classifier

Goal:
- Train a simple MNIST classifier with my own training loop
- Achieve > 98% accuracy
- Use this as the base template for future vision work

Files:
- `train.py` — main training script
- `models.py` — model definitions (simple MLP or CNN)
- `config.json` — hyperparameters
